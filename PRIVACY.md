# AI Recipes App Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: May 28, 2023_

## Introduction

Welcome to "AI Recipes" ("App"), an AI-driven app built in Flutter for creating and viewing recipes. This App is open-source and accessible via [Github](https://github.com/Topazoo/AI-Recipes-App). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights and responsibilities when using our App.

## Information We Collect

Our App collects information that you voluntarily provide when adding a new recipe. This may include the name of the recipe and other related details.

We do not collect, store, or share any additional personal data. We do not track user activity or collect device or location information.

When you input a recipe name and related details, we make an API call to ConjureAPI to generate the recipe content. ConjureAPI does not track or store user information, and we do not persist any information to the device in a database.

## How We Use Information

The recipe names and related details you provide are used solely for the purpose of generating and displaying the recipe content. We do not use this information for any other purpose.

## Your Rights

As we do not collect, store, or share any personal data beyond the recipe name and related details you provide, there is no personal information that you need to worry about being misused.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
